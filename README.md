# Portfolio

This is a Portoflio project and is designed to give me a skeleton structure for a professional web development portofolio. There are three HTML pages and 3 css pages included in this project. The HTML pages include a .index, which is serving as the "About Me" pages, a "Portfolio" page and a "Contact" page. 

The "Portfolio" page is intentionally left with placeholder copy and images because at this point in my web development career I have no completed enough projects to properly fill this out fully.

All three of these pages are responsive and feature components from Bootstrap with slight custom css applied to them.
