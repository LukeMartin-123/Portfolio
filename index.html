        <p class="lead">My name is Luke Martin and I am an aspiring web developer living in Denver, Colorado. I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and attended Syracuse University where I studied Advertising and Psychology. After graduating from Syracuse University in 2015, I made my way to New York City where I worked at two different advertising agencies. After spending 3+ years in the big city, I decided to make the move to Colorado and continued my advertising career. After almost two years at a small ad agency in Boulder, CO I decided it was time for a change and left my job to pursue a career in web development.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">I am currently attending a 12 week coding bootcamp that is hosted by the University of Pennsylvania and upon completion of this course I look forward to starting a new career in web development! </p>
